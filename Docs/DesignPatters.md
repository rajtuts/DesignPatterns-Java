## Structural Design Patterns – When to Use

| Pattern    | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Decorator** | - To modify or extend the functionality of an object without changing its base code.<br>- To implement additional functionalities of similar objects instead of reusing the same code. |
| **Facade** | - To simplify a client’s interaction with a system by hiding the underlying complex code.<br>- To interact with the methods present in a library without knowing the processing that happens in the background. |
| **Adapter** | - To enable old APIs to work with new refactored ones.<br>- To allow an object to cooperate with a class that has an incompatible interface.<br>- To reuse the existing functionality of classes. |
| **Bridge** | - To extend a class in several independent dimensions.<br>- To change the implementation at runtime.<br>- To share the implementation between objects. |
| **Composite** | - To allow the reuse of objects without worrying about their compatibility.<br>- To develop a scalable application that uses plenty of objects.<br>- To create a tree-like hierarchy of objects. |
| **Flyweight** | - To share a list of immutable strings across the application.<br>- To prevent load time as it allows caching. |
| **Proxy** | - To reduce the workload on the target object. |
